### Hi everyone..ðŸ‘‹..

This project was done as an assignment for my part 2.1 Web Development module at Harare Institute of Technology. The project is a company website which lists the services and products it provides. The project was done in pairs of two. The person I was paired with, **[John Diya](https://github.com/JohnDiya/)**, helped me in designing this website. 

## How to run project

To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a browser and yeah, that's it. Simple right?
